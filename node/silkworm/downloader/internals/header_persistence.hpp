/** HeaderPersistence save headers on the db. It has these responsibilities:
 *    - persist headers on the db
 *    - update canonical chain
 *    - detect unwind point
 *    - do headers unwind
 *    - signal (to other stages) to do an unwind operation
 * It is the counterpart of Erigon's HeaderInserter. Ideally it has to encapsulate all the details of the db
 * organization, but in practice this is not possible completely. Header downloader uses an instance of this class for
 * each forward() operation. When it receives headers from HeaderChain, that are ready to persist, the downloader call
 * persist() on HeaderPersistence. Conversely, in the unwind() operation the downloader call the HeaderPersistence's
 * remove_headers() method.
 *
 * HeaderPersistence has also the responsibility to detect a change in the canonical chain that is already persisted.
 * In this case the method unwind_point() reports the point to which we must return.
