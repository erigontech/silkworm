/** @brief Executes a batch of Ethereum blocks and writes resulting changes into the database.
 *
 * @param[in] txn Valid read-write LMDB transaction. Must not be NULL.
 * This function does not commit nor abort the transaction.
 * @param[in] chain_id EIP-155 chain ID. kSilkwormUnknownChainId is returned in case of an unknown or unsupported chain.
 * @param[in] start_block The block height to start the execution from.
 * @param[in] max_block Do not execute after this block.
 * max_block may be executed, or the execution may stop earlier if the batch is full.
 * @param[in] batch_size The size of DB changes to accumulate before returning from this method.
 * Pass 0 if you want to execute just 1 block.
 * @param[in] write_receipts Whether to write CBOR-encoded receipts into the DB.
 *
 * @param[out] last_executed_block The height of the last successfully executed block.
 * Not written to if no blocks were executed, otherwise *last_executed_block â‰¤ max_block.
 * @param[out] lmdb_error_code If an LMDB error occurs (this function returns kSilkwormLmdbError)
 * and lmdb_error_code isn't NULL, it's populated with the relevant LMDB error code.
 *
 * @return A non-zero error value on failure and kSilkwormSuccess(=0) on success.
 * kSilkwormBlockNotFound is probably OK: it simply means that the execution reached the end of the chain
 * (blocks up to and incl. last_executed_block were still executed).
