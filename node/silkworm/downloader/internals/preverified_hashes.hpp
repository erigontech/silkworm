 * PreverifiedHashes contains a set of headers that are known to belong to the canonical chain (i.e. they have been
 * added to the chain and the probability of them being removed is very close to zero).  Any header that is a parent of
 * a pre-verified header, can be considered to be pre-verified. This structure is used by the header downloader to skip
 * header verification for very old headers. Theoretically, it would be enough to only specify one pre-verified header.
 * But in practice, it makes sense to have a lot of them so that verification does not require loading the entire header
 * chain first.
 *
 * The set of pre-verified hashes must be generated with the toolbox utility provided with Silkworm and added manually
 * to the build of Silkworm. This is a task that will be accomplished by Silkworm authors that know which set of header
 * to add. The toolbox generate a .cpp file for a chain using headers in the chain local db. The generated file contains
 * the code that initialise a static instance of PreverifiedHashes so this instance must be listed here, as member of
 * the PreverifiedHashes class, like mainnet below. For the mainnet is already provided a file
 * preverified_hashes_mainnet.cpp
