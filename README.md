Silkworm
===

C++ implementation of the Ethereum protocol.
It's conceived as an evolution of the [Turbo-Geth](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth) project,
as outlined in its [release commentary](https://ledgerwatch.github.io/turbo_geth_release.html#Licence-and-language-migration-plan-out-of-scope-for-the-release).

# Building the source

# Clone the repository

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/torquem-ch/silkworm.git`

## Linux & macOS
Building silkworm requires [cmake](https://cgold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-step/installation.html) and a C++17 compiler.
Once the prerequisites are installed, bootstrap cmake build by running
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
(In the future you don't have to run `cmake ..` again.)

Then run the build itself
```
cmake --build . -j
```
Now you can check database changes (produced by [Turbo-Geth](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth)) with silkworm
```
./check_changes
```
or run tests
```
./tests
```
## Windows (Visual Studio Community Edition 2019)
* Install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Community edition is fine.
* Make sure your setup includes CMake support and Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17134.0)
* Open Visual Studio and select File -> CMake... 
* Browse the folder where you have cloned this repository and select the file CMakeLists.txt
* Let CMake cache generation complete (it may take several minutes)
* Solution explorer shows the project tree.
* To build simply `CTRL+Shift+B`
* Binaries are written to `%USERPROFILE%\CMakeBuilds\silkworm\build` If you want to change this path simply edit `CMakeSettings.json` file.

# Code style

We use the standard C++17 programming language.
We follow [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with the following differences:

* `snake_case` for function names.
* .cpp & .hpp file extensions rather than .cc & .h for C++.
* Exceptions are allowed.
* User-defined literals are allowed.
* Max line length is 100.
