## About Silkworm

Silkworm is a greenfield C++ implementation of the Ethereum protocol based on the [Erigon architecture].
It aims to be the fastest Ethereum client while maintaining the high quality and readability of its source code.
Silkworm uses [libmdbx] as the database engine.

Silkworm was conceived as an evolution of the [Erigon] project,
as outlined in its [release commentary](https://ledgerwatch.github.io/turbo_geth_release.html#Licence-and-language-migration-plan-out-of-scope-for-the-release).

Silkworm is under active development and hasn't reached the alpha phase yet.
Hence, there have been no releases so far.

## Obtaining Source Code

To obtain Silkworm source code for the first time:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/torquem-ch/silkworm.git
cd silkworm
```

Silkworm uses a few git submodules (some of which have their own submodules).
So after you've updated to the latest code with
```
git pull
```
update the submodules as well by running
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building on Linux & macOS

Building Silkworm requires:
* C++20 compiler: [GCC](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/) >= 10.2.0 or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) >= 12.0.0
* [CMake]
* Tools for [gmplib](https://gmplib.org/): `sudo apt-get install -y m4 texinfo bison`

Once the prerequisites are installed, bootstrap cmake by running
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
(In the future you don't have to run `cmake ..` again.)

Then run the build itself
```
make -j
```
_Note about parallel builds using `-j`: if not specified the exact number of parallel tasks, the compiler will spawn as many
as the cores available. That may cause OOM errors if the build is executed on a host with a large number of cores but a relatively
small amount of RAM. To work around this, either specify `-jn` where `n` is the number of parallel tasks you want to allow or
remove `-j` completely. Typically, for Silkworm each compiler job requires 4GB of RAM. So, if your total RAM is 16GB, for example,
then `-j4` should be OK, while `-j8` is probably not. It also means that you need a machine with at least 4GB RAM to compile Silkworm._

Now you can run the unit tests. There's one for core and one for node.
```
cmd/test/core_test
cmd/test/node_test
```
or [Ethereum Consensus Tests]
```
cmd/test/consensus
```

## Building on Windows

**Note! Windows builds are maintained for compatibility/portability reasons. However, due to the lack of 128-bit integers support by MSVC, execution performance is inferior when compared to Linux builds.**
* Install [Visual Studio] 2019. Community edition is fine.
* Make sure your setup includes CMake support and Windows 10 SDK.
* Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows).
* `.\vcpkg\vcpkg install mpir:x64-windows`
* Add <VCPKG_ROOT>\installed\x64-windows\include to your `INCLUDE` environment variable.
* Add <VCPKG_ROOT>\installed\x64-windows\bin to your `PATH` environment variable.
* Install [Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) (needed for OpenSSL build process)
* Open Visual Studio and select File -> CMake...
* Browse the folder where you have cloned this repository and select the file CMakeLists.txt
* Let CMake cache generation complete (it may take several minutes)
* Solution explorer shows the project tree.
* To build simply `CTRL+Shift+B`
* Binaries are written to `%USERPROFILE%\CMakeBuilds\silkworm\build` If you want to change this path simply edit `CMakeSettings.json` file.

**Note ! Memory compression on Windows 10/11**

Windows 10/11 provide a _memory compression_ feature which makes available more RAM than what physically mounted at cost of extra CPU cycles to compress/decompress while accessing data. As MDBX is a memory mapped file this feature may impact overall performances. Is advisable to have memory compression off.

Use the following steps to detect/enable/disable memory compression:
* Open a PowerShell prompt with Admin privileges
* Run `Get-MMAgent` (check whether memory compression is enabled)
* To disable memory compression : `Disable-MMAgent -mc` and reboot
* To enable memory compression : `Enable-MMAgent -mc` and reboot

## Codemap

Apart from the submodules and some auxiliary directories, Silkworm contains the following components:
* [`core`](./core)
  <br /> The `core` library contains the bulk of the Ethereum protocol logic as described by the [Yellow Paper].
  Code within `core` is compatible with WebAssembly and may not use C++ exceptions.
* [`node`](./node)
  <br /> The `node` library contains database, [staged sync] and other logic necessary for functioning as an Ethereum node.
  The `node` library depends on the `core` library.
* [`cmd`](./cmd)
  <br /> The source code of  Silkworm executable binaries.

## Testing Silkworm

**Note : at current state of development Silkworm can't actually "sync" the chain like Erigon does. What instead does is a one-pass loop over all implemented stages to process all blocks which are already in the database. Due to that you NEED a primed database from Erigon.**

You can try to run Silkworm to test the stages implemented so far. To do that you need to obtain a primed database by Erigon (strictly from `stable` branch) by forcing it to stop before stage Senders.

On Linux [build Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon#getting-started) and
```
export STOP_BEFORE_STAGE="Senders"
./build/bin/erigon --datadir <path-where-to-store-data>
```

On Windows [build Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon#windows) and
```
$env:STOP_BEFORE_STAGE="Senders"
./build/bin/erigon.exe --datadir <path-where-to-store-data>
```

After any of those steps (wait for completion) launch Silkworm and point it to the same data directory you've used for Erigon
```
cmd/silkworm --datadir <same-datadir-path-used-for-erigon>
```

## Style Guide

We use the standard C++20 programming language.
We adhere to [Google's C++ Style Guide] with the following differences:

* C++20 rather than C++17.
* `snake_case()` for function names.
* .cpp & .hpp file extensions for C++; .c & .h are reserved for C.
* `using namespace foo` is allowed inside .cpp files, but not inside headers.
* Exceptions are allowed outside the `core` library.
* User-defined literals are allowed.
* Maximum line length is 120, indentation is 4 spaces â€“ see [.clang-format](.clang-format).
* Use `#pragma once` in the headers instead of the classic `#ifndef` guards.
