/*
 * HeadersStage implement the header downloading stage.
 * Like the other stages it has two methods, one to go forward and one to go backwards (unwind) in the chain.
 * It is the counterpart of Erigon's HeaderForward and HeadersUnwind.
 *
 * HeadersStage internally uses HeaderChain and HeaderPersistence. The first represent the growing chain in memory
 * the second represent the growing chain on db. When headers are ready to be persisted they are withdrawn from
 * HeaderChain and transferred to the HeaderPersistence that write them on the db.
 *
 * HeadersStage has:
 *    - an execution loop
 *    - a forward/unwind method pair
 *
 *  The execution loop process messages that arrives in a concurrent queue. They are of 2 types:
 *    - inbound messages (from peers), like headers announcements (that we receive), responses for our header requests
 *    - outbound messages (to peers), like headers announcements (that we propagate), header requests
 *  Each message is class that encode in the execute() method the logic to process the message itself (command pattern).
 *  Those messages operate on the HeaderChain (asking needed headers or providing arrived headers) and use the sentry.
 *  Inbound messages are generated by the sentry, outbound messages are generated by the forward/unwind methods.
 *
 *  The forward method periodically
 *     - generate some outbound messages that ask HeaderChain to generate headers request,
 *     - check if HeaderChain has headers ready to be persisted
 *     - if there are some it uses HeaderPersistence to persist them
 *     - check if HeaderPersistence has detected an unwind point
 *     - check the conditions that determines the forward method to exit (unwind detected, chain in sync)
 *  The unwind method do headers unwind down to an unwind point.
 *
 *  Since the execution loop runs in its thread and the forward/unwind methods runs in the stage loop thread a
 *  synchronisation is needed. So the HeadersStage is partitioned in 2 half: one half runs the execution loop, the
 *  other half runs the forward/unwind methods; the two half communicate only by a MessageQueue that is a thread safe
 *  queue. Thus, HeaderChain is used only in the first half and not need lock protection, whereas HeaderPersistence is
 *  used in the other thread and also do not need lock protection.
